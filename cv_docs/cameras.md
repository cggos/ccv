#### [Pixy](https://pixycam.com/)

![pixy_cam.jpg](./images/pixy_cam.jpg)

**Pixy** is **the fifth version of the CMUcam, or CMUcam5**, but “Pixy” is easier to say than CMUcam5, so the name more or less stuck.  Pixy got its start in 2013 as part of a successful Kickstarter campaign, and as a partnership between **Charmed Labs** and **CMU**.

**Pixy2** was announced recently as Pixy’s smaller, faster, and smarter younger sibling.

### [OpenMV](https://openmv.io/)
The OpenMV(**Open-Source Machine Vision**) project aims at making machine vision more accessible to beginners by developing a user-friendly, open-source, low-cost **machine vision platform**.  

OpenMV cameras are programmable in **Python3** and come with an extensive set of **image processing functions** such as face detection, keypoints descriptors, color tracking, QR and Bar codes decoding, AprilTags, GIF and MJPEG recording and more.
